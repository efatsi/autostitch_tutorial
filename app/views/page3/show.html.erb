For the blurriness, I started cropping out the images so the overlapping image content didn't include anything important. <br />If you crop too much however, Autostitch won't see enough similarity between the pictures and will start leaving images out. <br />So toe that fine line if you must.
<br /><br /><br />

<%= image_tag("4.JPG", :width => "197", :height => "350")%> <b> TO </b> <%= image_tag("4_good.JPG", :width => "136", :height => "350")%>

<b>...AND...</b>

<%= image_tag("6.JPG", :width => "197", :height => "350")%> <b> TO </b> <%= image_tag("6_good.JPG", :width => "141", :height => "350")%>

<br /><br /><br />
And/Or just crank away in photoshop, I did both. <br />With the following tools: stamp, smudge, blur (in that order), you can pretty much do anything to make all your stitching dreams come true. <br />And here's the final product!
<br /><br /><br />

<%=  image_tag("final_product.jpg", :width => "70%", :height => "70%")%>
