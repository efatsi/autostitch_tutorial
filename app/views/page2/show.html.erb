Then, you'll need to have installed <%= link_to "autostitch", "http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/brown/autostitch/autostitch.html" %>, (Windows download link <%= link_to "here", "http://www.cs.bath.ac.uk/brown/autostitch/autostitch.zip" %>). <br />It's a wicked small but awesome program that really does most of the work for you. <br />Once, you have that, open it up and select File -> Open, and navigate your way to wherever you stored the pictures you took.
<br /><br /><br />

<%= image_tag("autostitch_screenshot.jpg", :width => "30%", :height => "30%")%>

<br /><br /><br />

Select all the pictures you want stitched together (holding ctrl for windows or command for mac), click on the Open button. <br />Then sit back as Autostitch cranks away! This one took about 10 seconds.<br />If the pictures share enough image content, you should end up with something like this:
<br /><br /><br />

<%= image_tag("first_attempt.jpg", :width => "80%", :height => "80%")%>

<br /><br /><br />
If you're happy with the new product, that's awesome! <br />As you can see, there is a lot of weird stuff going on at the bottom and some of the me's are pretty blurry. <br />Continue on for the tweaking process!
